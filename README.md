**`(Coder/Data Collector/Game Enthusiast)`**

I'm an undergraduate student at Denison University currently pursuing my degree in Computer Science. I want to break into the gaming industry thus I strive for all of my projects to be gaming related. All of my projects are built from the ground up with passion and care so I hope you take a look and find something you might like ðŸ˜Š
